# coqney
Easter Egg language processor. Teach your userbase to speak French automagically. 

## How does it work?
Use this software to generate the glue code that would replace words in the input strings based
on the substitution rules, which consist of both word-to-word substitutions, enging-to-ending ones
and a stop list of words that should not be replaced. "I worked" becomes "Je work√©". You get the idea.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have Lua 5+ installed. You proably do though.

## Usage
```
./conqney [-q|-s|-v] [-g|-p] \
    [-o output-file] [-f frequencies-file] \
    [-i [input-file] [rules-file] 
```
* `-g` runs the code generation mode, producing includable glue code source, `-p` is the default mode and just 
processes the input in accordance to rules;
* `-v` shows statistics about substitutions made on the standard error stream and is the default, `-s` acts 
likewise, but only prints a single number as a ratio rather than a percentage, `-v` suppresses any statistical
output. Neither key is meaningful in `-g` mode;
* `-f` outputs frequencies of the words encountered in the CSV file specified by `frequencies-file`, has no
meaning in `-g` mode;
* `rules-file` is the lua script without the `.lua` extension specifying the substitutions to do,
refer to the default `anglofrench.lua` for an template;
* If input and/or output are not specified, standard input/output streams are assumed;

Note: at the time of writing nothing of that works xD
